Takeaway Challenge
==================

## Makers Week 2 Friday Solo Challenge Part 2

Task
-----

* To write a Takeaway program. 

* I will implement the following functionality:

  * Have a list of dishes with prices.

  * Placing the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".

  * The text sending functionality will be implemented using Twilio API.

  * It will make sure that the program is thoroughly tested and that I use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when my tests are run.

  * However, if my Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent.
